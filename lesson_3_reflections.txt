When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to colaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might add things I am not sure about.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a copy of another reposotory on github
A clone is a copy of a local repository

a branch is a modification away from the master.
