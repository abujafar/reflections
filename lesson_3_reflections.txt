When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to colaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might add things I am not sure about.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a copy of another reposotory on github
A clone is a copy of a local repository

a branch is a modification away from the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the 
last known state of the remote stored locally?

When there is no internet access

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

To store work in a central location. Sharing would be easier. but the learning curve 
for git and github would be hard initially.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch 
rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I am going to  want feedback before finalizing.
